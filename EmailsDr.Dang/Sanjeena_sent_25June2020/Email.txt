Hey Anjali,

It looks like the problem is that you have everything in inside a loop for g. For unconstrained model (UUU), all g’s have their respective lambda, beta, and psi so it doesn’t make a difference. But for UCC model, lambda is unconstrained but the Psi is constrained. So, in order to update Psi, you need lambdas for all g updated so you need to have them in separate loop. I wrote a mini function for UCC modifying the code that I sent you and my old code. Also notice there are some changes in the convergence check for the internal loop as well. It seems to be working fine. Take a look and we can always have a zoom meeting if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Sanjeena

Hey Anjali,

Thank you for sending this. I will take a look at towards end of the week.

Sounds good. I just wanted to further clarify the changes. If you want to modify your code, you basically need to follow the structure below:

1st Loop: Update the variational parameters for all Gs and the means.
2nd Loop: Update Lambda for all Gs.
3rd Loop: Update Psi for all Gs.

This is because for constrained Psi, you are using information from all Lambda, not just the g^th lambda so you need all Lambdas updated before you can update Psi and vice-versa.




Best wishes,
Sanjeena
